# Appendix Exercises

These are some exercises used as 'appendix' to certain exercises from the book or simply ways to play around concepts introduced in the actual exercises. Exercises ending with a number are related directly to the exercises on the book, while those ending with a letter are exercises I use to understand how things work outside of the context of a program.

The "array" folder contains a simple exercise based on arrays that I'm trying to solve in various ways while I'm going through the book.
